# tree_img_model

My first time creating an image model with keras.  I have created some cnn with the tensorflow.keras.IMDB data set and the tensorflow.keras.reuters data set.  This is my first try using my own harvested images.

TODO:
1. the test notebook needs work.  It is not working at the moment.
2. add model.history and plot to weed out overfitting
